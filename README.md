Project Overview:- 
This project demonstrates the generation of anime-style faces using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to create high-quality synthetic images that closely resemble real anime character faces.

Two models are used:-
Generator: Produces synthetic anime faces.
Discriminator: Classifies images as real or fake.

Through adversarial training, the generator learns to create realistic images that can "fool" the discriminator.

🧠 Objective:-
To build and train a DCGAN that generates diverse and visually realistic anime faces from random noise input, using a large dataset of preprocessed anime face images.

🛠️ Environment & Tools:-
Platform: Kaggle Notebook

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

📂 Dataset:-
Source: Anime Faces Dataset – [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/anime-faces)

Contains 21,551 cropped and cleaned anime face images.

🧪 Model Highlights:-
Implemented using DCGAN architecture.
Trained on >21k images.
Tuned learning rates for both generator and discriminator.
Trained over 100+ epochs.

Output: Visually diverse anime faces resembling dataset samples
